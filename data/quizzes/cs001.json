                    "explanation": "The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component that processes instructions and performs calculations (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and data management (Control Unit). RAM is volatile memory used for temporary storage of active data, while ROM contains permanent start-up instructions. The Hard Disk is a long-term storage device, not a processing unit."

                    "explanation": "The CPU is composed of the ALU, which performs mathematical and logical comparisons, and the CU, which directs the flow of data and instructions between the CPU and other devices. The Motherboard is the main circuit board that connects these parts, but it does not house these units within itself as a single processor does."

                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "Cache memory is a very high-speed memory area that acts as a bridge between the CPU and the slower RAM. It stores the most frequently accessed instructions so the CPU doesn't have to wait for data from the main memory. This significantly speeds up processing. It is much smaller than RAM or hard drive storage."

It stores the data and programs currently being processed by the CPU to ensure fast performance. Unlike the Hard Drive, RAM is volatile, meaning its contents are lost when power is turned off. BIOS is stored in ROM, and Internet connections are managed by Network Interface Cards."
