For example, if larger seeds become the only food source, a bird population's average beak size will shift toward the larger end of the spectrum."

A classic example is Sickle-cell anemia; heterozygotes are resistant to malaria, which keeps the recessive 's' allele in the population even though the homozygous 'ss' condition is harmful. This preserves genetic variation."
