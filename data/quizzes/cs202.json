        "explanation": "According to the CS202 handouts, front-end development is not design itself; rather, the developer stands between the designer and the back-end developer. Their primary responsibility is to translate design into code (HTML/CSS/JS) and ensure that user interactions are handled correctly. Designing is the role of the Graphic/UI Designer, while server-side logic and hardware management belong to Back-end and DevOps roles respectively.",
