                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "In subtraction, the result must be rounded to the least number of decimal places present in any of the original numbers. Since '12.0' has only one decimal place, the mathematical result (0.11) must be rounded to '0.1'. Retaining two decimal places (Option 0) would incorrectly imply a higher level of precision than the measurement allows."

It is tested by deliberately making small changes to the method (e.g., changing the pH of a buffer or the temperature slightly) to see if the results remain consistent.
