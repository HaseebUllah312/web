                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "Rationalism is the approach where knowledge is derived through logic and argumentation. A 'rationalist' argues that if the premises are true and the logic is sound, the conclusion must be true, regardless of physical observation. Empiricism (Option 0) is the opposite, relying on sensory experience, while Positivism (Option 2) is a systematic application of empirical observations to find universal laws."

                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "Ethical neutrality, also known as value freedom, means that the researcher's personal values, beliefs, or biases should not distort the research process or the findings.

                    "explanation": "Self-correction means that science is an evolving process. No theory is final; as new evidence emerges through replication and re-observation, existing knowledge is refined, updated, or even discarded. This ensures that scientific knowledge remains as accurate as possible over time."
