Loans (Consumer Financing) are the primary assets because the interest paid by borrowers is the bank's revenue. Customer deposits (Option A) are actually liabilities because the bank owes that money back to the customers and must pay interest on them.

                    "explanation": "In a standard Bank Business & Operating Model, customer deposits represent the core liability. These funds are 'borrowed' from the public at a lower interest rate and then deployed as loans (assets) at a higher rate. Option 0 describes investment or development banking, while Option 3 is incorrect because branches are delivery channels, not the income source itself."
