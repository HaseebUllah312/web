High water activity facilitates enzymatic reactions and microbial metabolism. Water is not a source of energy (Choice A) or vitamins (Choice D), and it typically lowers or stabilizes temperature rather than increasing boiling points significantly in a way that prevents spoilage."

While some specific foods like milk or wheat use different factors (e.g., 6.38 or 5.7), 6.25 is the standard universal factor for crude protein estimation."

                    "explanation": "The saponification value is inversely proportional to the mean molecular weight of the fatty acids in a fat. A higher value indicates a larger number of shorter-chain fatty acids per gram of fat. Degree of unsaturation (Choice A) is measured by the Iodine Value."

                    "explanation": "Winterization is a process of fractional crystallization. Oils are cooled slowly to allow high-melting-point glycerides (stearins) to crystallize, which are then filtered out. This ensures the oil remains clear and liquid in a refrigerator or during cold weather. It is a physical separation based on melting points, not a biological or nutritional treatment."

Toughening the bran prevents it from shattering into small pieces that would speckle the white flour, while softening the endosperm makes it easier to grind into fine particles. This optimizes both the quality and the yield of the flour."

By creating more disulfide cross-links, it strengthens the dough's structure, allowing it to hold more gas and resulting in a larger, symmetrical loaf. Due to health concerns, many countries have replaced it with ascorbic acid."

Its high protein content and specific gluten quality produce a dough with high 'tenacity' but low 'extensibility,' which is ideal for the extrusion process of pasta and ensures the final product remains 'al dente' and does not turn into a mushy mass when cooked."
