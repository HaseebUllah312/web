These serve as foundational references for suggesting improvements to other food crops through comparative genetics. Options like Zea mays are mentioned later in the context of transposable elements rather than initial model completion, while others like B. thuringiensis are microbes or animal model systems[cite: 1, 41]."

                    "explanation": "The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) is the joint initiative between the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)[cite: 36, 37]. PIR is a protein resource , ExPASy is a portal for proteomics and other resources in Switzerland , and TIGR was the institute where the first bacterial genome was sequenced."

                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "In a FASTA header line, which begins with a 'greater than' sign (>), the 'gi' stands for 'gene identification'. This is typically followed by a unique numerical ID used by databases like NCBI to track sequence records. It is distinct from the accession number, which is a separate stable reference string."

                    "correct": 2,
                    "explanation": "Standard amino acid codes are assigned single letters from A to Z, though some are not commonly used. Glutamic acid is represented by 'E'[cite: 160, 164]. Alanine is 'A', Glycine is 'G', and Aspartic acid is 'D'. These codes are essential for compact sequence storage and computational alignment."

Sequin is designed for complex sequences, large datasets, and offline submissions that require advanced annotation tools and graphical reports. SPIN is the corresponding tool for UniProt submissions."

                    "explanation": "A critical task in genome analysis is identifying and masking out repeats. Repeats can cause the assembly to 'jumble up,' so it is important to identify these regions[cite: 269, 270]. Gene prediction follows assembly , while structural and functional annotations involve identifying specific features and biological roles respectively[cite: 380, 385]."

This relationship became mutually dependent, forming a crucial element in eukaryotic evolution."
