                    "explanation": "Mendel's First Law, the Principle of Segregation, states that during gamete formation, the two alleles for a trait separate so that each gamete receives only one allele. This explains why a recessive trait can reappear in the F2 generation. Choice A refers to Independent Assortment; Choice C is a simplified and technically incorrect view of dominance; and Choice D describes the 'blending inheritance' theory which Mendel's work successfully refuted."

                    "explanation": "In a cross between two heterozygotes (Aa x Aa), the genotypic ratio is 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa. However, since both AA and Aa exhibit the dominant phenotype under complete dominance, the resulting phenotypic ratio is 3 dominant to 1 recessive. 1:2:1 is the genotypic ratio; 9:3:3:1 is the ratio for a dihybrid cross; and 1:1 is the ratio for a testcross involving a heterozygote."

If any offspring show the recessive phenotype, the unknown parent must be heterozygous. While Choice C relates to mapping, the specific definition of a testcross is aimed at genotype verification for dominant traits."

This results in the four phenotypic classes (9:3:3:1) because the inheritance of trait A does not influence the inheritance of trait B, provided the genes are on different chromosomes."

Since alleles are located on these homologs, this movement represents the physical separation (segregation) of alleles. Choice A involves crossing over, and Choice B involves the separation of sister chromatids, which is less directly the 'first' point of segregation for alleles of a gene."

                    "question": "Why do biophysicists study 'bioluminescence' in organisms like jellyfish or fireflies?",
                    "options": [
                        "To understand how they communicate socially.",
                        "To study the physical mechanisms of chemical-to-light energy conversion and use these as molecular markers (e.g., GFP).",
                        "To determine the nutritional value of deep-sea fish.",

                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "Bioluminescence involves complex energy transfers and electronic transitions. By studying these, biophysicists have developed tools like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which allows scientists to 'light up' specific parts of a living cell to see them in action. Choice B highlights the focus on energy mechanisms and practical applications."
