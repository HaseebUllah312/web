If they remain outstanding for an unusually long period (e.g., six months or more), they may be lost, cancelled, or part of a fraud scheme. If these cheques are no longer valid, the cash balance is currently understated, and the corresponding liability (accounts payable) is overstated. The auditor must investigate these stale cheques to ensure they represent valid, ongoing obligations."

To verify its existence and accuracy, the auditor must inspect the bank statements from the first few days of the subsequent accounting period.

Standard financial reporting frameworks dictate that overdrafts must be presented as current liabilities because they are generally repayable on demand. Crucially, they cannot be 'netted off' or offset against positive cash balances held in different accounts or different banks unless there is a formal, legally enforceable right to set off the amounts.

They check that goods received under the recorded GRNs were included in the physical count and the liability recorded in the current year, and that goods dispatched under subsequent GDNs were properly excluded from inventory and recorded as sales in the following year.
