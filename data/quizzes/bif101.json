                    "explanation": "A chimeric alignment occurs when a single sequencing read does not align linearly to one location. This typically happens due to structural variations, such as genomic translocations or gene fusions, where the read represents a set of linear alignments that do not have large overlaps. In these cases, one alignment is designated 'representative' and the others 'supplementary'."
