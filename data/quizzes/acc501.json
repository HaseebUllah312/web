                    "explanation": "Capital budgeting involves identifying investment opportunities where the value of the cash flow generated by an asset exceeds the cost of that asset. To do this, a manager must assess the size of the cash flow (how much), the timing (when), and the risk (uncertainty). Option A relates to market analysis, Option C defines working capital management, and Option D is an accounting objective."

                    "explanation": "The Pie Model suggests that the value of the firm is the sum of its debt and equity. The financial manager's goal is to choose the mixture of debt and equity (the capital structure) that makes the whole 'pie' as large as possible. If the total value increases, the stockholders are generally better off. Option A is a potential strategy but not the ultimate goal; Option D is counterproductive to value creation."

Deciding between these two sources of funds is the essence of the financing decision. Option A and C relate to assets, not sources of funds."

                    "explanation": "M&M argued that capital structure is irrelevant because individual investors can borrow money themselves to achieve their desired risk level (leverage).
