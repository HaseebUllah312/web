                    "explanation": "In banking, liabilities represent the sources of funds that the bank owes to others.

                    "explanation": "In a bank, deposits are liabilities because the bank owes that money to the customers. Therefore, the function that manages deposits handles the liability side.

                    "correct": 1,
                    "explanation": "Maturity Mismatch (or Liquidity Risk) occurs because banks often lend money for long periods while the deposits they use to fund those loans can be withdrawn at any time. If too many depositors withdraw at once, the bank may face a liquidity crisis because its assets cannot be liquidated quickly enough to meet the demand. This is a core challenge in the BOM. Options A, C, and D are not recognized financial risks in this context."

Economic Capital is the amount of equity the bank holds to ensure it remains solvent in the face of these rare but high-impact losses. Options 0, 2, and 3 do not represent the risk-management function of capital."

Because callus tissue is often associated with genetic instability and mutations (somaclonal variation), bypassing this stage ensures higher clonal fidelity. Option 0 is incorrect as direct methods are usually faster, and Option 2 refers to somatic hybridization."
